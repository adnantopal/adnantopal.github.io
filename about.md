#### My name is Adnan Topal. I'm a 27-year old front-end developer, focusing on **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. Over the last few months I turned my attention to **hybrid mobile development** technologies and mostly concentrated on this area.

I live in the gorgeous [Antalya](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Antalya,+Turkey/@36.8980543,30.6480653,7z), a city located in the mediterranean coast of Turkey, where the sun always(almost) warms you, though it becomes insufferable at times in the summer. Having lived in Istanbul (always wondered why would someone put up with living in and settle there) in the past for 1.5 years, it is really a blessing to live in such a beautiful city.

### A Brief Professional History

I have been working as a front/back-end web developer for over 7 years. Back in the day, I preferred back-end development with PHP until 2012, however, I felt the need to make a choice between front-end and back-end development after seeing that web development technologies is evolving exponentially each day and JavaScript is becoming more and more popular in both front-end and back-end web development; and I decided to continue as a front-end developer mostly concentrated on JavaScript development with solid HTML/CSS skills.

Currently I'm working as a freelancer and writing front-end code for my corporate clients, and tinkering with hybrid mobile development technologies in my spare time. I have been also serving as a web consultant since the second half of 2013 and giving consultations about e-commerce conversion optimization and A/B testing.

### Adnan in Real Life

When I'm not looking at the screen of my computer, I enjoy looking at the screen of TV to watch movies and play video games. I love football, and follow European football, particularly Premier League, as much as I can and watch the games when I don't have something better to do. Besides watching, I also like to be on the pitch as a goalkeeper and stop the ball from entering the goal. I'm an avid runner and go out for a run whenever I feel bad or just to appreciate the day, and want to run a marathon in the near future.
