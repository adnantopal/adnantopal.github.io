#### My name is Adnan Topal. I'm a 27-year old front-end developer, focusing on **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. Over the last few months I turned my attention to **hybrid mobile development** technologies and mostly concentrated on this area.

I live in the gorgeous [Antalya](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Antalya,+Turkey/@36.8980543,30.6480653,7z), a city located in the mediterranean coast of Turkey, where the sun always(almost) warms you, though it becomes insufferable at times in the summer. Having lived in Istanbul (always wondered why would someone put up with living in and settle there) in the past for 1.5 years, it is really a blessing to live in such a beautiful city.

### A Brief Professional History

I have been working as a front/back-end web developer for over 7 years. Back in the day, I preferred back-end development using PHP until 2013, however, I felt the need to make a choice between front-end and back-end development after seeing that web development technologies is evolving exponentially each day and JavaScript is becoming more and more popular in both front-end and back-end web development; and I decided to continue as a front-end developer mostly concentrated on JavaScript development with solid HTML/CSS skills.

In the past, I mostly served as freelance web developer who is building business web sites for corporate clients, in addition to developing and maintaining a web based role playing game between the years 2009 and 2012. The game started as a hobby project, and eventually evolved into a business that makes income. The game was sold to a company in Turkey in 2012.

I have been also serving as a web consultant since the second half of 2013 and giving consultations about e-commerce conversion optimization and A/B testing.

### Adnan in Real Life

When I'm not looking at the screen of my computer, I enjoy looking at the screen of TV, and watch movies and playing video games. I like following European football, particularly Premier League and watch the games when I don't have more important things to do.
